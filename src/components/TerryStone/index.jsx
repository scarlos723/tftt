        <p>
        “I believe It’s just a matter of time before most Television and Film
        productions adopt
        some form of digital money as part of their own business modelling, the
        Darkhorse team have
        developed a cryptocurrency and NFT’s (Non-Fungible Tokens) platform that
        could potentially revolutionise the way film
        production companies engage with fans around the world, and together with
        ongoing revenues for all
        stakeholders we have potentially developed an industry game changer,
        we are full steam ahead and
        aim to launch the new platform within the first Qtr. of 2022”.
